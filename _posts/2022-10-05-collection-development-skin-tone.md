I've been asked the question: why is it necessary to keep anatomy textbooks up-to-date in our collection? Anatomy doesn't change that much over time, right? 

But the *representation* of anatomy has, in fact, changed over time. Anatomy textbooks are now making more of an effort to depict a wider range of skin colors in anatomical illustrations. This means, practically speaking, that older anatomy textbooks will tend to have less diversity in terms of skin color, while more recently published anatomy textbooks are more likely to embrace the push for diversity.

Other medical resources, too, have attempted to rectify what's now seen as inadequate representation of dermatologic and other pathological conditions affecting people of color. For example: [Skin deep](https://dftbskindeep.com/) and [Mind the gap: A handbook of clinical signs in Black and Brown skin](https://www.blackandbrownskin.co.uk/mindthegap).

Consciously working to increase diverse representations of skin color in medical library collections, then, is an important consideration for medical librarians. This has real implications for the quality of students' medical education and, ultimately, for patient care: if a physician isn't familiar with the appearance of pathological conditions across a range of skin colors, they may not be able to provide a correct diagnosis.
