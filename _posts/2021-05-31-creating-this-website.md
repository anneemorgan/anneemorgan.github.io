This website was created using a [portfolio template](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio) forked from evanca. 
The step-by-step tutorial for using the template is on [Medium](https://blog.usejournal.com/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd).
The website is hosted from my GitHub repository by GitHub Pages, and uses a Minimal Jekyll theme.


The blog was created by following a [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) provided by Jonathan McGlone.
