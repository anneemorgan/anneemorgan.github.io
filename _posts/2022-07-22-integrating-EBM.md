I've been thinking about how important it is to deliberately align medical library collection development policies and practices with the tenets of evidence-based medicine (EBM). In *Evidence-Based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM*, Straus, Glasziou, Richardson, and Haynes describe how to find "current best evidence" (p. 35). The authors advise: "Treat traditional textbooks as if they were long past their 'best before' date" (p. 36). These print books can be thought of as "decomposing garbage," susceptible to "rot" (p. 36-37). Ultimately, they're "dangerous waste," not even fit to be recycled (p. 39). According to the authors, they should be replaced by online resources updated on a regular basis (p. 40).

How can this movement away from print be reflected in a collection development policy? My impression is that **weeding** is particularly important from an EBM perspective. The Texas State Library and Archives Commission's [*CREW : A Weeding Manual for Modern Libraries*](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/sites/default/files/public/tslac/ld/ld/pubs/crew/crewmethod12.pdf) outlines a series of criteria, "MUSTIE," for weeding: misleading, ugly, superseded, trivial, irrelevant, elsewhere. Misleading, superseded, and irrelevant are key here.

But--in my conversations with other librarians, it seems like weeding in medical libraries isn't taking place nearly as much as it should. **That's a lot of rot in the stacks.** A few arguments I've encountered in favor of retaining old library materials:

1. The information in the books is still useful
2. The books are of historical value

*Information still useful*

Old medical texts can contain outdated medical information: for example, the statement that "alcohol is not a carcinogen." This doesn't reflect the current scientific consensus.

There are potentially serious consequences if a medical library retains old books, including: students and faculty becoming misinformed; negative effects on grades and overall scholarly success; damage to the library's reputation.

*Historical value*

Medical libraries aren't archives or historical societies. 
The purpose of medical libraries needs to be articulated in order to clarify why information needs to be up-to-date and accurate. Is the purpose to support historical research or current medical education? Who are the library's main users? Most likely, the answer will be medical students and faculty. If this is the case, the collection will need to be tailored to meet their information needs.
