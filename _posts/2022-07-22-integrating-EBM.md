I've been thinking about how important it is to deliberately align medical library collection development policies and practices with the tenets of evidence-based medicine. 

The [CREW weeding manual](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/sites/default/files/public/tslac/ld/ld/pubs/crew/crewmethod12.pdf) outlines a series of criteria, abbreviated as "MUSTIE," for weeding: misleading, ugly, superseded, trivial, irrelevant, elsewhere. "Superseded" and "irrelevant" are key here.

A few arguments I've encountered in favor of retaining old library materials:

1. Information still useful -- maps to "superseded"
2. Historical value -- maps to "irrelevant"

*Information still useful*

Old medical texts can contain outdated medical information: for example, the statement that "alcohol is not a carcinogen." This doesn't reflect the current scientific consensus.

There are potentially serious consequences if a medical library retains old books: students and faculty becoming misinformed; negative effects on grades and overall scholarly success; damage to the library's reputation.

*Historical value*

Medical libraries aren't archives or historical societies. 
The purpose of medical libraries needs to be articulated in order to clarify why information needs to be up-to-date and accurate. Is the purpose to support historical research or current medical education?

Medical librarians developing collection policies should ask: who are the library's main users? Most likely, the answer will be medical students and faculty.
