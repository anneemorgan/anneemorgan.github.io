A brief overview:


This website was created using a [portfolio template](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio) forked from evanca. 
The step-by-step tutorial for using the template is on [Medium](https://blog.usejournal.com/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd). 


The website is hosted from my GitHub repository by GitHub Pages, and uses a Minimal Jekyll theme. The source code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/#), which is a permissive free and open source software license. The content of the blog itself is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).


The blog was created by following a [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) provided by Jonathan McGlone.
