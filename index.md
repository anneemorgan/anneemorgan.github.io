## About me

I have a Bachelor of Arts in History from Truman State University and a Master of Science in Information Studies from the University of Texas at Austin. My undergraduate education immersed me in historical research. My graduate education, in addition to various positions in libraries and archives, pulled me towards supporting research and access to knowledge. 

**Research is like detective work.** Each new lead builds on the accumulated knowledge that came before it. As an information worker, my goal is to help this process of search and discovery take place--to facilitate scholarship and learning. Accordingly, I've gained experience with archival processing, cataloging, data analysis, digitization, and metadata management. I've also worked in a wide variety of settings, including academic and digital libraries, archives, a museum, and a research institute.

I edit Wikipedia articles in my spare time.
