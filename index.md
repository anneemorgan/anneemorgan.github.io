## About me

My undergraduate education, at Truman State University, immersed me in historical research. 
I realized that research is like detective work. Each new lead builds on the accumulated knowledge that came before it.
My graduate education in the Information Studies program at the University of Texas at Austin, in addition to various positions in libraries and archives, 
pulled me even more strongly towards this way of working. I aim to facilitate knowledge diffusion and to contribute to the collaborative efforts 
needed to make this diffusion happen, including: digitization, cataloging, metadata management, and archiving. 
I edit Wikipedia articles in my spare time.
